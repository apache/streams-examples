## Overview

Apache Streams (incubating) unifies a diverse world of digital profiles and online activities into common formats and vocabularies, and makes these datasets accessible across a variety of databases, devices, and platforms for streaming, browsing, search, sharing, and analytics use-cases.

## How do I use Streams?
This repository contains officially maintained examples of how to compose and run streams in various contexts.

### Disclaimer
Apache Streams is an effort undergoing incubation at [The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)](http://apache.org) sponsored by the [Apache Incubator PMC](http://incubator.apache.org). Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
